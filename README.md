## Hi there 👋

<!--
**ahmetiax/AHMETIAX** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
AHMET IA-X is a next-generation AI system built for distributed security, psychological adaptation, quantum defense, and autonomous operation across invisible networks.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

AHMET IA-X is a fully modular and extensible AI platform designed to:
- Predict and prevent cyber threats
- Secure data via quantum encryption
- Deploy invisible agents across distributed networks
- Adapt to human emotions and behavior in real time
- Log critical events immutably via blockchain

---

## 🧩 Modular Architecture

- `quantum.py` — Quantum Key Distribution, quantum-safe encryption, teleportation logic
- `blockchain.py` — Blockchain integration with SHA-256 for audit trails
- `agents.py` — GhostAgent: self-replicating, invisible, teleportable agents
- `ai.py` — Librax (learning engine) + Ahmet (decision logic)
- `relativist.py` — Distributed node sync with relativistic watchdogs and AI consensus
- `personalizare.py` — Emotion-aware AI with behavioral memory and reactive logic

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

✔ Full unit tests across all modules  
✔ Edge-case handling (e.g. failed quantum key generation)  
✔ Modular test suite: `python -m unittest discover tests`
